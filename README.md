## First project:
**Link:** https://vladyslavssotnikov.github.io/4_home/  
This project demonstrates the coding of the PSD template in HTML and CSS.  
For convenience of coding, the LESS preprocessor is used.  
Also made adaptive, that all devices (phones, tablets, laptops) looked the same good, for this I used the Flexbox module.  
There are two slides on the page, they were implemented using the jQuery Slick Slider plugin.  

## Second project:

The rules of “The Game in Life”:  

* "Life" develops in the cellular field
* Each cell has 8 neighboring cells
* Each cell  is in one of two possible states, alive or dead
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation
* Any live cell with more than three and less two live neighbours dies
